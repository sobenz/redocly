# Getting Started
REST APIs provide the ultimate in flexibility and control, best for server-to-server scenarios
or when a native SDK doesn't exist for your application.

## Steps to Launch
 * Review our [Terms of Use](/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).
 * Register your app to retrieve an evaluation API key.
 * Build your application against Glympse REST APIs.
 * Request a production key for your app by clicking Upgrade Plan in the My Apps section.
 * Ship your application after transitioning your application to production API calls.
